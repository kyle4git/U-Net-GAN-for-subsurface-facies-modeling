# U-Net-GAN-for-subsurface-facies-modeling
This repository shows the code used in the paper "U-Net Generative Adversarial Network for subsurface facies modeling".<br>
## Required libraries 
[Python 3.8.5](https://www.python.org/)<br>
[PyTorch 1.6.0](https://pytorch.org/)<br>
[matplotlib 3.3.1](https://matplotlib.org/)<br>
[numpy 1.19.1](https://numpy.org/)<br>
## Development environment
Training of the GANs was performed on a NVIDIA 1070Ti GPU (Ubuntu, Intel i9-7900x CPU and 128GB RAM).
All experiments apart from GAN training are performed on a laptop with NVIDIA 1050Ti GPU (Windows 10, Intel i5-7300HQ CPU and 16GB RAM).
The code is verified on a machine without NVIDIA graphics processor (Windows 10, Intel i7-8700 CPU and 8GB RAM).
